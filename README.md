# ImmediateStyle 
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/immediatestyle/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

ImmediateStyle is a convenient style wrapper around Unity's UI components. All the benefits of an Immediate Mode UI but without having to give up the power of the Unity Editor. Layout out your UI in the typical Unity way and then, using code generation, immediately start coding their behaviors.

Allows you to interact with Unity UI GameObjects in an Immediate Style (like an Immediate Mode)

Why do 

```    rightButton.onClick.AddListener(RaiseValue);```

You can instead do

```    if(ImmediateStyle.Button(CanvasLeftd414).IsMouseDown){}```

## Features
1. Instead of coding manually and then creating your Unity UI Components, we instead create your Unity UI Components and then code generate (No more missing reference exceptions)
2. Code gen tools to make sure you only spend time coding functionality or doing layout. No more wasting times setting references in the inspector.
3. Works with every existing Unity UI component and is compatible with existing Classes, callbacks, and inspector sent callbacks
4. Has a new component called DragAndDrop that is useful for Pills and other UI functionality.

## Installation

- Add this GitHub URL to your package manager or in your 'manifest.json' add
```
  "dependencies": {
	...

    	"com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle": "https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/ImmediateStyle",

	...
  }
```


## APIs
There's some useful APIs for speeding up the multiplayer testing workflow.
Here's a basic example: 
```
ImmediateStyle.SetColor(Color.Red);
ImmediateStyle.Image("-PathToImageFollowedByAutoGeneratedGuidGoesHere-")
ImmediateStyle.ClearColor();
if (ImmediateStyle.Button("-PathToButtonFollowedByAutoGeneratedGuidGoesHere-").IsMouseDown) {
    // Write your code for what to do when this specific button is clicked
}
```
Check out the examples folder and scene to see all the API end points in action. (If there is something you want to try we are hoping that it is comprehensive enough to already have it because we believe UI should be that easy! So let us know if we fell short)

## How does it work?
We just map all the components in the Start function into a Dictionary by a GUID. Then we just set a bool denoting they were interacted with that frame. It really is that simple and makes UI that much more easy to deal with. No more registering/unregistering callbacks in Awake/Start and having scattered logic across 20 files.
