# ImmediateStyle 
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/immediatestyle/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

ImmediateStyle is a convenient style wrapper around Unity's UI components. All the benefits of an Immediate Mode GUI but without having to give up the power of the Unity Editor Layout System. Layout your UI in the typical Unity way and then, using code generation, immediately start coding response behaviors.

This allows you to interact with Unity UI GameObjects in an Immediate *Style* (similar in API form to an [Immediate Mode GUI](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0001))

Why do the following

```    rightButton.onClick.AddListener(RaiseValue);```

when you can simply do

```    if(ImmediateStyle.Button(CanvasLeftd414).IsMouseDown){}```

## Features
1. Has a new component called **Element** that adds what you need to a GameObject for the new ImmediateStyle API to work. Instead of coding manually and then creating your Unity UI Components, we instead create your Unity UI Components and allow you to code generate (No more missing reference exceptions).
* Use Code gen tools to make sure you only spend time coding functionality or doing layout. No more wasting time setting up references in the inspector.
*  Works with every existing Unity UI component and is compatible with existing Classes, Callbacks, and Inspector Callbacks (So you trying it out doesn't involve rewriting your entire codebase).
2. Has a new component called **Reference** that is useful for finding game objects (and Debug.Asserts if it could not be found). This is can code generate (to save you time typing) and it makes it easy to obtain a component (For Start/Awake) without having missing references in the inspector.
3. Has a new component called **DragAndDrop** that is useful for Pills and other more advanced UI functionality.

## Installation

- Add this GitHub URL to your package manager or, instead, in your 'manifest.json' add
```json
  "dependencies": {
	...

    	"com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle": "https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle.git",

	...
  }
```

None of that working? **Honestly, just grab the repo from out of the zip** and just toss it in to your project like you would any other script.

## Examples
Please look at [Style Comparisons](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle/blob/main/StyleComparisons) folder for more elaborate examples that are setup like the real world. (or specifically [Immediate Example](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle/blob/main/StyleComparisons/ImmediateExample.cs) to hop right into a code example) 
The following is a basic example of using the **Element** component: 
```cs
protected void Update()
{
	ImmediateStyle.SetColor(Color.Red);
	ImmediateStyle.Image("-PathToImageFollowedByAutoGeneratedGuidGoesHere-");
	ImmediateStyle.ClearColor();
	
	if (ImmediateStyle.Button("-PathToButtonFollowedByAutoGeneratedGuidGoesHere-").IsMouseDown) {
	    // Write your code for what to do when this specific button is clicked
	}
}
```
The [Style Comparisons](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.immediatestyle/blob/main/StyleComparisons) folder (and scenes) is your best bet to get your hands dirty. (If there is something you want to try, we are hoping that the examples are comprehensive enough to already have it. We believe UI should be that easy! So let us know if we fell short)


The following is a basic example of using the **Reference** component: 
```cs
protected void Start()
{
        background = Reference.Find<SpriteRenderer>(this, "-AutoGeneratedGuidGoesHere-"); // We save you mental anguish and time!
}
```

The following is a basic example of using the **DragAndDrop** component in a callback way  **(you can still do it the Immediate Style way but we provide this way additionally as to not force you to do it "OUR WAY")**: 
```cs
protected void Start()
{
        dragDrop.OnReleased.AddListener(DragDrop_OnReleased); // Also is a UnityEvent. "Designers" can set this in the inspector instead.
}
```

## How does it work?
For **Element**, we just map all the components (in the Awake/Start function) into a Dictionary by a GUID. Then we just set a bool denoting they were interacted with that frame. It really is that simple and makes UI that much more easy to deal with. No more registering/unregistering callbacks in Awake/Start and having scattered logic across 20 files/classes/functions. In fact you don't even have to type that much because we code gen the UI usage code for you.
For **Reference** , we basically just call `FindObjectOfType<>` under the hood. We Debug.Assert for conveinece so you can be alerted right away if you deleted the GameObject from the inspector (normally you wouldn't know you had a missing reference until the component got used sometime later). We then just check for the matching GUID. In a nutshell it is faster/better than `GameObject.Find` since you can't have conflicting names, we only search by component type, and we do a convenient assert.
For **DragAndDrop**, we just simply make the gameobject that is clicked on follow the cursor (conditionally).
